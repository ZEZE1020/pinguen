## Getting Started with Development

1. Set up your development environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZEZE1020/pinguen.git
   cd pinguen/backend
   go mod download
   ```

2. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Implement your changes, following these guidelines:
   - Write tests for new features
   - Follow Go best practices and idioms
   - Keep functions focused and modular
   - Add proper documentation
   - Update README.md if needed

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   go test -v ./...
   go test -race ./...
   go test -cover ./...
   ```

5. Submit your pull request:
   - Provide a clear description of the changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include test results
   - Update documentation as needed

## Code Style Guidelines

1. Follow standard Go formatting:
   ```bash
   gofmt -s -w .
   ```

2. Use golint and go vet:
   ```bash
   golint ./...
   go vet ./...
   ```

3. Follow these principles:
   - Keep functions under 50 lines
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Write self-documenting code
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Use consistent error handling

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation
3. Add entry to CHANGELOG.md
4. Get review from maintainers
5. Squash commits before merge
